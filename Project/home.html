                        this is where the Naga Hills merge with the Patkai Range in which form the boundary with Burma.
                        Rivers such as the Doyang and Diphu to the north, the Barak river in the southwest, dissect the entire
                        state. 20 percent of the total land area of the state is covered with wooded forest, a haven for flora
                        and fauna. The evergreen tropical and subtropical forests are found in strategic pockets in the state.[36]
